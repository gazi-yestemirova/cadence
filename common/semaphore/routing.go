//  1. OwnerIDToBucket picks the bucket from the request's owner_id.
//  2. RingKey names that bucket on the membership ring, which picks the Matching host.

// cannot free the slot its acquire took. For the same reason, numBuckets must come from NumBuckets
// on the semaphore's stored size and bucket_size, which never change after creation.
